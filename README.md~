backplane-cli is a CLI tool to interact with [backplane api](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-api).

## Installation

### Option 1: Download from release

Download the latest binary from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/releases) page.

For example, to download the binary on Linux:

```
$ wget https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/releases/download/v0.1.1/ocm-backplane_0.1.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf ocm-backplane_0.1.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ chmod +x ocm-backplane
$ mv ocm-backplane $GOBIN
```

### Option 2: Build from source

First clone the repository somewhere in your `$PATH`. A common place would be within your `$GOPATH`.

Example:

```
$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
$ git clone git@github.com/openshift/backplane-cli.git
```

```
$ make build
```

This command will build the backplane-cli binary, named `ocm-backplane`. This binary will be placed in $PATH.
As the binary has prefix `ocm-`, it becomes a plugin of `ocm`, and can be invoked by `ocm backplane`.

For more information about ocm plugins, please refer https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli#extend-ocm-with-plugins

## Configuration

The configuration file of backplane-cli is expected to be located at `$HOME/.config/backplane/config.json`.

## Setup bash/zsh prompt

To setup the PS1(prompt) for bash/zsh, please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/blob/main/docs/PS1-setup.md).

## Login

#### Example

In this example, we will login to a cluster with id `123456abcdef` in production environment, and we have the OCM client environment setup [like this](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli#log-in).
- Run backplane login in another terminal.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster>
  ```

- Run `oc` command to access the target cluster.
  ```
  $ oc whoami
  system:serviceaccount:openshift-backplane-srep:1234567
  ```
  
- To login to the Management cluster for HyperShift (or) the managing Hive shard of normal OSD/ROSA cluster
  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster> --manager
  ```
- To login to the Service Cluster of a HyperShift hosted cluster or the Management Cluster
  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster> --service
  ```

### Login to multiple clusters 

Logging into multiple clusters via different terminal instances.
- How to log into the first cluster

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster-id-1> --multi
  $ export KUBECONFIG= <cluster-id-1-kube-config-path>
  ```

- How to log into the second cluster

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster-id-2> --multi
  $ export KUBECONFIG= <cluster-id-2-kube-config-path>
  ```

## Console

- Login to the target cluster via backplane as the above.
- Run the below command and it will launch the console of the current logged in cluster.
  ```
  $ ocm backplane console
  --> Console will be available at http://127.0.x.x:xxxx
  ```
- Follow the above link `http://127.0.x.x:xxxx` to access console.

  #### Open in browser

  You can directly open the console in browser by adding flag -b or setting environment variable `BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true`. Example,

  When running this command, it will open the console in the browser automatically.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane console -b
  ```

  Or set the environment variable

  ```
  $ export BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true

  $ ocm backplane console
  ```

  Optionally, you can also load the enabled console plugin
  ```
  $ ocm backplane console -plugins
  ```
  > Note: Load the console plugin from backplane-cli is not sufficient to access the console plugin,
  backplane-api to expose the console plugin service explicitly is needed.

## Cloud Console

- Login to the target cluster via backplane as the above.
- Run the below command and it will launch the cloud console of the current logged in cluster.
  ```
  $ ocm backplane cloud console
  Console Link:
  Link: https://xxxxx
  ```
- Follow the above link to access the console.

  #### Open in browser

  You can directly open the console in the browser by adding flag `-b` or setting the environment variable `BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true`.
  
  When running this command, it will open the console in the browser automatically.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane cloud console -b
  ```

  Or set the environment variable

  ```
  $ export BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true
  $ ocm backplane cloud console
  `

## Backplane Session 
Backplane session command will create an isolated environment to interact with a cluster in its own directory. 
The default location for this is ~/backplane. 

The default session save path can be configured via the backplane config file. 
```
{
   "url": "your-bp-url"
   "proxy-url": "your-proxy-url"
   "session-dir":"your-session-dir"
}
```
### How to create new session?
The following command will create a new session and log in to the cluster.
```
## with intractive session name 
ocm backplane session <session-name> -c <cluster-id>

## only with cluster id
ocm backplane session <cluster-id> 
```

Backplane session keeps the session history commands in <your-path>/session-name/.history file.

```
[ <session-name> (<cluster-info-PS1>)]$ history 
    1  2023-05-08 15:06:05 oc get nodes
    2  2023-05-08 15:06:13 oc get co
    3  2023-05-08 15:06:40 history 
```

Backpalane session setup following environment variables.
```
HISTFILE    = <your-session-path>/<session-name>/.history
PATH        = <your-os-path>
KUBECONFIG  = <your-session-path>/<session-name>/<cluster-id>/config
CLUSTERID   = <cluster-id>
CLUSTERNAME = <cluster-name>
```

### How to delete the session?
Folowing command delete the session
```
ocm backplane session --delete <session-name>
```


## Debugging issues

To help diagnose any issues, you can modify the default verbosity of the logger. Use `-v` for `info` level or explicitly setting the logging level by using `--verbosity=debug` flag.

For further information on logging levels refer to the in-built help.

```
$ ocm backplane help
```
