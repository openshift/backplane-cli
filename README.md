# Backplane-CLI

## What it does
Backplane-cli is a CLI tool to interact with Backplane-api, which is a management service that consolidates all access to OSD and ROSA clusters and cloud provider resources. Backplane handles authentication and authorization through OCM profiles, practices least privilege access to those OSD/ROSA clusters and cloud resources, and provides auditing capabilities for compliance and security.
