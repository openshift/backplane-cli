backplane-cli is a CLI tool to interact with [backplane api](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-api).

## Installation

Go should be installed in your local system with version 1.19 

### Option 1: Download from release

Download the latest binary from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/releases) page.

For example, to download the binary on Linux:

```
$ wget https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/releases/download/v0.1.1/ocm-backplane_0.1.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf ocm-backplane_0.1.1_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
$ chmod +x ocm-backplane
$ mv ocm-backplane $GOBIN
```

### Option 2: Build from source

First clone the repository somewhere in your `$PATH`. A common place would be within your `$GOPATH`.

Example:

```
$ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
$ git clone git@github.com/openshift/backplane-cli.git
```

```
$ make build
```

This command will build the backplane-cli binary, named `ocm-backplane`. This binary will be placed in $PATH.
As the binary has prefix `ocm-`, it becomes a plugin of `ocm`, and can be invoked by `ocm backplane`.

For more information about ocm plugins, please refer https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli#extend-ocm-with-plugins

## Configuration

The configuration file of backplane-cli is expected to be located at `$HOME/.config/backplane/config.json`.

## Setup bash/zsh prompt

To setup the PS1(prompt) for bash/zsh, please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/openshift/backplane-cli/blob/main/docs/PS1-setup.md).

## Login

#### Example

In this example, we will login to a cluster with id `123456abcdef` in production environment, and we have the OCM client environment setup [like this](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli#log-in).
- Run backplane login in another terminal.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster>
  ```

- Run `oc` command to access the target cluster.
  ```
  $ oc whoami
  system:serviceaccount:openshift-backplane-srep:1234567
  ```
  
- To login to the Management cluster for HyperShift (or) the managing Hive shard of normal OSD/ROSA cluster
  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster> --manager
  ```
- To login to the Service Cluster of a HyperShift hosted cluster or the Management Cluster
  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster> --service
  ```

### Login to multiple clusters 

Logging into multiple clusters via different terminal instances.
- How to log into the first cluster

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster-id-1> --multi
  $ export KUBECONFIG= <cluster-id-1-kube-config-path>
  ```

  you can also directly run

  ```
  $ source <(ocm backplane login <cluster-id-1> --multi)
  ```

- How to log into the second cluster

  ```
  $ ocm backplane login <cluster-id-2> --multi
  $ export KUBECONFIG= <cluster-id-2-kube-config-path>
  ```

## Console

- Login to the target cluster via backplane as the above.
- Run the below command and it will launch the console of the current logged in cluster.
  ```
  $ ocm backplane console
  --> Console will be available at http://127.0.x.x:xxxx
  ```
- Follow the above link `http://127.0.x.x:xxxx` to access console.

  #### Open in browser

  You can directly open the console in browser by adding flag -b or setting environment variable `BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true`. Example,

  When running this command, it will open the console in the browser automatically.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane console -b
  ```

  Or set the environment variable

  ```
  $ export BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true

  $ ocm backplane console
  ```

  Optionally, you can also load the enabled console plugin
  ```
  $ ocm backplane console -plugins
  ```
  > Note: Load the console plugin from backplane-cli is not sufficient to access the console plugin,
  backplane-api to expose the console plugin service explicitly is needed.

## Cloud Console

- Login to the target cluster via backplane as the above.
- Run the below command and it will launch the cloud console of the current logged in cluster.
  ```
  $ ocm backplane cloud console
  Console Link:
  Link: https://xxxxx
  ```
- Follow the above link to access the console.

  #### Open in browser

  You can directly open the console in the browser by adding flag `-b` or setting the environment variable `BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true`.
  
  When running this command, it will open the console in the browser automatically.

  ```
  $ ocm backplane cloud console -b
  ```

  Or set the environment variable

  ```
  $ export BACKPLANE_DEFAULT_OPEN_BROWSER=true
  $ ocm backplane cloud console
  `
## Monitoring
Monitoring command can be used to launch the specified monitoring UI.

Run this command from within a cluster :

```
ocm backplane monitoring <prometheus/alertmanager/thanos/grafana> [flags]
```

>Note: Following version 4.11, Prometheus, AlertManager and Grafana monitoring UIs are deprecated for openshift-monitoring stack, please use 'ocm backplane console' and use the observe tab for the same. Other monitoring stacks remain unaffected.
## Backplane Session 
Backplane session command will create an isolated environment to interact with a cluster in its own directory. 
The default location for this is ~/backplane. 

The default session save path can be configured via the backplane config file. 
```
{
   "url": "your-bp-url"
   "proxy-url": "your-proxy-url"
   "session-dir":"your-session-dir"
}
```
### How to create new session?
The following command will create a new session and log in to the cluster.
```
## with intractive session name 
ocm backplane session <session-name> -c <cluster-id>

## only with cluster id
ocm backplane session <cluster-id> 
```

Backplane session keeps the session history commands in <your-path>/session-name/.history file.

```
[ <session-name> (<cluster-info-PS1>)]$ history 
    1  2023-05-08 15:06:05 oc get nodes
    2  2023-05-08 15:06:13 oc get co
    3  2023-05-08 15:06:40 history 
```

Backplane session setup following environment variables.
```
HISTFILE    = <your-session-path>/<session-name>/.history
PATH        = <your-os-path>
KUBECONFIG  = <your-session-path>/<session-name>/<cluster-id>/config
CLUSTERID   = <cluster-id>
CLUSTERNAME = <cluster-name>
```

### How to delete the session?
Folowing command delete the session
```
ocm backplane session --delete <session-name>
```
## Promotion/Release cycle of backplane CLI
Backplane CLI has a default release cycle of every 2 weeks 

In case of you have changes that have immediate impact and would need an immediate promotion, please reach out to:

Backplane team (alias : @backplane-team) in #sd-ims-backplane slack channel 

## Debugging issues

To help diagnose any issues, you can modify the default verbosity of the logger. Use `-v` for `info` level or explicitly setting the logging level by using `--verbosity=debug` flag.

For further information on logging levels refer to the in-built help.

```
$ ocm backplane help
```

## Vulnerability Scanning with `govulncheck`

As part of our continuous integration (CI) process, we've incorporated `govulncheck` to identify known vulnerabilities in the `backplane-cli` codebase.
Following each CI execution, especially when PRs are submitted, a detailed vulnerability report can be found in `build-log.txt`. This is nested within
the `artifacts/test/` directory of the `ci/prow/scan-optional` test. To retrieve the report:
- Click on `Details` next to `ci/prow/scan-optional` in a specific PR.
- Click `Artifacts` at the top-right corner of the page.
- Navigate to `artifacts/test/` to view the `build-log.txt` containing vulnerability information.

While some detected vulnerabilities might be non-blocking at the moment, they are still reported. We encourage both users and developers to thoroughly
review these reports. If any Go packages are flagged, consider updating them to their fixed versions.

To manually execute a vulnerability scan locally, run the following command:
```
make scan
```
